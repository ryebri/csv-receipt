Used to analyze and reformat data from Google Forms.

Reads comma separated (.csv) or tab delimited (.txt) and produces a receipt.

How to create these formats:
Export/download the form data from Google Sheets to an Excel spreadsheet
Delete out anything that is not a column name (ie. Name, email, phone, section, Large T-Shirt, Small T-Shirt, and etc.)
DELETE ALL TOTALS AND ANY DATA NOT RELATED TO AN ORDER
In Excel, click 'Save As' and choose either tab-delimited or comma separated value.


How to run the program:
Double-click on the name
Insert the file path to the comma separated value or tab-delimited file you just created
In the next box insert the path to the destination folder
In the first drop-down menu select how many orders you wish to have on one page
In the next drop-down menu select how many fields need to be placed on every order form (ie. name, phone, email)
For the radio-buttons, select whether the file with the data is tab-delimited or comma separated value
Click create forms
